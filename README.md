Quantum Mechanics - IP[y]: notebooks
======

Ipython notebooks for a Quantum Mechanics class. The material is based on (and in sequence with) Mark Beck's book "Quantum Mechanics: Theory and Experiment"

These are a mix of in-class activities (Chapter title) or longer lab-length activities (Lab title). The labs are numbered in order, and the title corresponds to book chapter titles.

To run interactive versions of these notebooks, please: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/amcdawes/QMlabs)

The notebooks make use of the [QuTiP package](http://qutip.org) (Quantum Toolbox in Python). For additional documentation on this requirement, please see the project page. Installation of QuTiP should be handled by your python package manager:

Anaconda (mac/win): `conda install qutip`

Mac/Linux: `pip install qutip`

I personally recommend the [Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) for ease of installation on Windows machines. I use it on Mac OSX as well. Linux package managers (and `pip`) generally make the same type of python package management straightforward.
